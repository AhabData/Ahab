Introduction

Ahab is an open source api, built to automate data processing. Ahab lets you connect valid github repositories in a pipeline of data-processing awesomeness. Build your pipelines at [ahabdata.com](http://ahabdata.com) and run them using the provided api endpoint.

Requirements
----------------

Github repositories can be used in a pipeline if they have a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/) which prescribes the execution of the application along with the data output format and location.
