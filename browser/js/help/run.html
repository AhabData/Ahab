    <p>
      Once you've successfully built your pipeline, running it is simple. We've provided an API endpoint for each pipeline which you can simply run a GET request to from anywhere, anytime. The response will be sent in JSON. Optionally, you may add a callback as a query paramater to your request, to which the response will be posted once the pipeline has finished running.
